# Grade-Sender
Python3 script for grade sending

# Usage
Please use the jupyter notebook interface. **Do CHANGE the Configuration**

'**DEBUG**' should be changed to '**False**' in order to send emails to students. Otherwise all emails go to the '**user_account**'

Or try to utilize the functions written in gradeSender.py. Detailed description will be updated later.

Currently, it supports formatted .csv file, with `example.csv` given for reference.

The system that I used has limitation on the sending frequency. The standby time may vary with your own system.
